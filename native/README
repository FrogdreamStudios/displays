Building native library

cd native
chmod +x build.sh

# Build for current platform (default)
./build.sh

# Or specify target platform
./build.sh current    # Same as default
./build.sh linux      # Build for Linux (requires Docker)
./build.sh windows    # Build for Windows (requires Docker)
./build.sh all        # Build for all platforms

Then build the Java project:
cd ..
./gradlew build
