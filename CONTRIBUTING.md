## Contributing

We welcome contributions to Dream Displays! Whether it's fixing bugs, adding new features, or improving other things,
your help makes the project better for everyone.

### How to contribute

1. **Fork the repository** and make your changes on a separate branch
2. **Follow the existing code style and structure** – consistency is important for maintainability
3. **Test your changes thoroughly** to ensure they work as intended and don't break existing features
4. **Submit a Pull request** describing your changes clearly and linking any relevant issues

### Tips

- Keep commits focused
- Ensure your code compiles and runs correctly in **both client (Forge, NeoForge, etc.)** and **all forks (Bukkit,
  Folia, etc.)**
- Update documentation if your changes introduce new features
- Respect the project's license
- Respect our guidelines

Thank you for helping make Dream Displays better!
